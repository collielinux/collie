# Superwhisper ships as the default dictation backend, but its per-user setup
# (service, shortcuts, bar panel) needs a live session, so it runs here rather
# than in the image. Unattended: no settings window, no toast. An image built
# without the package is left alone, since first-run cannot ask for sudo.
